\title{Detect changepoints with the E-divisive algorithm}
\usage{
detect_changepoints_edivisive(x, min_seg_len = 12L, R = 199L, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{wa_ts} tibble produced by \code{\link[=as_wearable_ts]{as_wearable_ts()}}.}

\item{min_seg_len}{Minimum number of observations permitted in any segment.}

\item{R}{Number of permutations used to compute the reference distribution.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level required to accept a split (default \code{0.05}).}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{id}, \code{cp_time}, \code{p_value}, and \code{method}. The
tibble has zero rows when no changepoints are detected.
}
\description{
Implements a univariate version of the E-divisive procedure based on energy
distance to detect distributional changepoints. Candidate changepoints are
assessed via a permutation test and accepted when the p-value is below
\code{alpha}. Detected changepoints are then investigated recursively on the left
and right segments subject to the same minimum segment length constraint.
