\title{Resample a wearable time series onto an even cadence}
\usage{
resample_series(x, by = "5 min", agg = c("mean", "last", "median"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{wa_ts} tibble produced by \code{\link[=as_wearable_ts]{as_wearable_ts()}}.}

\item{by}{Character string understood by \code{\link[base:seq.POSIXt]{base::seq.POSIXt()}} that defines the
target sampling cadence (default "5 min").}

\item{agg}{Aggregation strategy applied when multiple observations fall into
the same resampling window. Choose from "mean", "last", or "median".}
}
\value{
A \code{wa_ts} tibble sampled on the requested cadence. Metadata attributes
\code{lower}, \code{upper}, \code{cadence}, \code{tz}, and \code{dups_dropped} are preserved, with
\code{cadence} updated to the new cadence in seconds.

ts <- as_wearable_ts(data, id = id, time = time, value = value)
