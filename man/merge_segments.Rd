\usage{
merge_segments(..., gap = "5 min")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Individual detection results as data frames/tibbles or a single
named list. Objects can come directly from \code{\link[=detect_flatlines]{detect_flatlines()}},
\code{\link[=detect_saturation]{detect_saturation()}}, \code{\link[=detect_rate_change]{detect_rate_change()}}, \code{\link[=detect_changepoints_pelt]{detect_changepoints_pelt()}},
or \code{\link[=detect_changepoints_edivisive]{detect_changepoints_edivisive()}}.}

\item{gap}{Maximum gap tolerated between neighbouring detections (per id)
before they are collapsed into a single segment. Can be a character string
understood by \code{\link[base:difftime]{base::as.difftime()}} or a numeric number of seconds.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{id}, \code{start}, \code{end}, \code{source}, \code{subtype},
\code{score}, \code{notes}, and \code{components}. The \code{components} column stores the
underlying detections contributing to each merged segment.
}
\description{
Standardises the outputs of the artifact detectors, changepoint detectors,
and other anomaly routines into a common schema before merging overlapping
segments within each subject. The merged output includes a \code{components} list
column that records the contributing detections for downstream scoring.
